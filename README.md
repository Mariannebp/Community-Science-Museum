Type: Semester Project 1
When: spring/fall 2021
Where: Front End Developmment course, Noroff

## Description
The Community Science Museum is a website for a new museum coming near you. 

This website was my first semester project at Noroff. The assignment was to create a website for the Community Science Museum using HTML and CSS. The target group were school children aged 7-15, and families. The site should be informative and engaging, but also encourage the viewers to come visit the actual museum. We were given a folder with images and text we could use.
