## Description

The Community Science Museum is a website for a new museum coming near you.

This website was my first semester project at Noroff. The assignment was to create a website for the Community Science Museum using HTML and CSS. The target group were school children aged 7-15, and families. The site should be informative and engaging, but also encourage the viewers to come visit the actual museum. We were given a folder with images and text we could use.
