- Type: Semester Project 1
- When: spring/fall 2021
- Where: Front End Development course, Noroff School of technology and digital media.

## Description

The Community Science Museum is a website for a new museum coming near you. Here visitors will find information about what the museum has to offer, both in type of exhibitions and of the museums facilities. Visitors are also able to contact the museum for tickets and other questions or feedback.

This website was my first semester project at Noroff. The assignment was to create a website for the Community Science Museum using HTML and CSS. The target group were school children aged 7-15, and families. The site should be informative and engaging, but also encourage the viewers to come visit the actual museum. We were given a folder with images and text we could use.
